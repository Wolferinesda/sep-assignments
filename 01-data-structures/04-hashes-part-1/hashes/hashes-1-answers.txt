1. Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

  Doubling the size of the array will end up causing us to copy all that previous data into another array.
  This in turn, causes more cost for performance and less efficiency. Not only that, but every time we double the array,
  we double the amount of empty places in our array and end up fragmenting our array. This fragmentation eats up memory due
  to more spots being taken up by empty spots.
