** Explanation as to how the Line application works **

Everything is encompassed in the class "Line" so that it runs these functions when altering the list of people in the line.
I created an attribute accessor so that I can access what I'm looking to add to my array which are members.
For my line.rb file, I had the initialize function running first to generate the empty array in order to add people to the line.
I created a join method with the parameter of person, so that whatever the parameter is will be added to the array.
I then created the leave method with the person parameter again so that whatever parameter is entered will leave the array.
  It accesses the index at which the person is located and deletes them and the outputs the string of the remaining array.
I then created the front method which accesses the person at the front of the array.
Then I created the middle method. Here I create the variable index which identifies the middle of the array by dividing the
  indices by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number and then output the member at that index.
The back method is similar to the front method except I'm just locating the back of the array instead of the front.
The search method allows us to find a person at a specific point in the array. We create a person_index variable which
  we will use to identify if the index actually exists. Then we use the index method defined in our last line as long as the
  index exists.
Then our final method index will return the person's index which is utilized by the other methods.


1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

  My data structure allows developers every option to sort, add, delete, and find members in a line by sorting them in an array.
  These methods in turn can alter the dynamic of the array.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

  You would be able to use Line.search(person) in order to find a specific person by using the index(person) method. Also
  you could use the screen.rb methods where it identifies the specific coordinates in which it will return the elements of the
  array at those coordinates.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

  This is applicable to almost anything where there is a line. For example, You're at the grocery store waiting and there's a
  long line. There's always a front, back, and middle and the line can change. Say someone new enters the line or someone
  forgot something and has to leave the line, or the person at the front finishes paying for everything.
  Then the dynamic of the line changes and the array is different. You can also apply this to amusement parks or movie lines or
  basically anything where people are waiting in a line.



  ** Explanation as to how the Screen application works **

The screen.rb file is initialized with a width and height for the matrix that contains the coordinates for the pixels.
Then the insert method is defined which inserts the coordinates assigned to x and y so long as they exist and are not
  greater than the height or width and are not less than 0.
The pixel.rb file works with the screen.rb file in order to add the correct color so long as it exists and doesn't exceed
  the normal bounds of 0 or 255.

  1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

    The data assigned these coordinates and colors allows the user to manipulate the x and y coordinates in order to modify the
      data while also assigning them the rgb color values.

  2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

    You would use the at() method from the screen.rb file. It correctly identifies the element at the given coordinates.

  3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

    This structure can be used in any case where there is a grid or graph of data that is located at specific coordinates.
